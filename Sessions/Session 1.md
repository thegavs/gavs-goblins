The tyrant [[Clemow Venning]] ruler of [[Pengelley]] summons the part and tasks them to investigate reports of goblins affecting the trade betwen [[Amme]] and [[Nivag]]and report to [[Donirert Craddick]] the mayor of [[Nivag]]. He also states to report to [[Mellyn]] so he can get reports back.

When he leaves a potted plant start speaking with the party believing this to be [[Mellyn]] the party interacted with the plant until a suit of armour was revealed to be [[Mellyn]].  They stated that if this was the best the Kingdom had to investigate the world was in trouble!  It was agreed that plant based keywords would be used to guard against dopplegangers.

The party spent a few days travelling staying in road side inns with particularly bad food.  Seeing a herd of deer crossing the road they strayed off to hunt dinner.   A plumb deer was shot and when the party gathered around it they were attacked by four hungry wolves.

After a short battle which seemed to involve a lot more falling over than necessary was resolved with the wolves dead and the party drinking health potions.

The party arrived in [[Nivag]] late and took up lodgings in an inn,  drinking with the patrons they discovered that there was problems with goblins along the high and low road with the last caravan arriving over a week ago.  The merchants seemed worried about this.

A poor attempt at flirting was made with a large hulking figure called [[Sizzle]] who the party discovered hated goblins and was here to hunt them.

The next morning the party went to the town hall to speak with the Mayor, initially they were refused access but were shown into his office were they did some snooping around.  When the mayor arrived he denied there was a goblin problem stating that his men were clearing the high and low road and would be back soon, but if the party wanted they could look at the old lost wet road.  he id appear to say that goblins were our friends.

The party left and decide to split up half following [[Brek]] and the other half talking to merchants.

[[Brek]] was seen going around  merchants then into cobblers were he stated "you know what to do to get the job done".   One of the party then got drunk with [[Brek]] and found out that he had been telling all the merchants that the party would escort them to [[Amme]] and promised to provide horses and a  carriage for the party.

The rest of the party in the Inn were surprised that people thought they were providing protection.   They found out that the high road is suitable for pack horses only, with the low road suitable for carts.
