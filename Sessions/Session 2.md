Having been railroaded into escorting carts via the low road the party decided that this was an obvious trap so decided to sabotage a few carts and start a fight between merchants as a distraction.  This went well and the party left a day ahead of the merchants to scout out the road to make sure it was safe.

When on the road the party became aware of a creature following them.  A particularly poor attempt at hiding meant that the creature was not surprised, this is good as it was [[Sizzle]].  He stated he was following the party to make sure they were safe and competent.   The party stated that they were safe and competent,  at this point [[Sizzle]] showed them a sack containing 3 goblin heads that he stated were following the party and he killed them.  The party protested that they were indeed competent just a little hungover that day.

He agreed to go back to [[Nivag]] and accompany the merchants the next day when the party scouted ahead.  The party found one the campsites for the night and checked the area for potential threats.  One was detected hiding in the thorn wall protecting the campsite, four needle blights attacked the party,  sleep was cast on two and the other two swiftly dispatched.  The sleeping enemy was then murdered in their thorny beds.

An investigation showed that there were suspicious tracks outside the thorn barrier that looked like the needle blights were put there deliberately.  These tracks lead to a tree.   Given the failing light the party decided to rest and investigate in the morning.

Next day the tree proved to be a particularly tricky tree to investigate.  The party looked around it, under it, attempted to look inside it, before climbing the tree to discover  a rope walkway hidden in the canopy.  These rope bridges proved a bit tricky to traverse with one play falling and ending on death saves.   The rope bridges lead to a large ravine with the bridge continuing over it.  The ravine was too steep to climb down so the party decided to cut the ropes to thwart others using it.

An attempt to bribe and talk with badgers went reasonably well with the party able to gather that goblins used the rope bridges and were last seen 4 days ago(ish).  As the spell "talk with animals" still had some time the party decided to find out the names of their horses.  One was called Karen, pity the player with a horse called Karen!

Returning to the road the party found a bridge over the ravine.    One member crossed it and spotted a goblin hiding in a cave by the bridge close to the party.  One shot from a longbow dispatched the goblin.   The party climbed down to cave which was small but deep.  Once inside the party discovered that the walls inside were crudely carved from rock, indicating goblin rather than dwarf construction.  The ceiling was only 5 feet high

The tunnel lead under the bridge then split into two, one appearing to lead to a cave and the other to a door.    As the party approached the door the goblin/s inside called out a greeting.
