Session 15 started with the predictable death of the brightly painted Chicken Brain.     In [[Pengelley]] one character tried to blow up lots of ships by ordering gunpowder inspections but was foiled by the goblins strict adherence to Health and safety regulations.  Back under the Sentinel the shame of half fixing the gate lead to the Paladin getting very drunk and suffering a 3 day hang over.

The Jailer got his old equipment out of store and now has shinny amour and a long sword.   The Ransom for the 3 cheap characters was paid by [[Ardent]] but they refused to pay 1,000,000GP for the Jailer.   The Jailer released 3 prisoners that looked roughly like the original bodies.

Back in the goblin fleet the Admiral found a very fast goblin boat and took it back to the sentinel to meet up with the other characters.  The goblin wizzard was very impresed with the work the Paladin had done and promoted them to Major.  He then tasked them with taking the fast magic boat out to sea to scout the shore.

Heading out the party came across the bridge from [[Session 11]] seeing movement in the water they killed a Bullywug and its Gaint Leech.  Turning the cannon on the bridge for no apparent reason they destroyed part of the bridge making it easier for large ships to pass.

An unfortunate misfire ended up killing Barry the ogre who was not having a good day anyway as the goblins were making fun of his arm bands anyway.

Going to the abandoned city from [[Session 5]] the party found some parts that could be used to fix the broken gate under the Sentinal.    A slight misadventure found the Gate Major swimming with sharks but they managed to clamber back aboard with only a few nibbles.

During the day the party saw 4 boats out at sea, under cover of darkness they approached the first one, this turned out to be a simple fishing boat which responded by throwing fish at the party.  Having been hard in the past by  Halibuts the party retreated and attacked  the easier target of a pirate ship.  The battle is ongoing with 4 of the pirates killed so far.
