The party continued towards [[Amme]] stopping at another bridge as the badgers became concerned.    On the other side of the bridge was a spear topped with a helmet with a note attached.   Daring [[Sizzle]] walked over the bridge to collect the helm and note.  As her returned two arrows landed where the spear was.

The merchants and [[Sizzle]] recognised the helm as from the town guards sent out from [[Nivag]] to clear the road.  The note read.

"Ransom 100GP to be paid in 5 days"

The "dodgy" merchant had to admit that he was captured by the goblins  and his business partners paid 50GP to release him.

The party decided to carry on to [[Amme]] and walked over the bridge.   On the other side the party were aware of goblins hiding in the trees.  Arrows again hit the bridge far from the party as a warning shot.   One of the party decided to taunt the Goblins by walking back and forth over the bridge.   The taunting worked as they got shot by an arrow.  A quick investigation of the arrow was confusing with the head being of high quality metal but the shaft and flights being of crude goblin constructions.

The party then called for the goblins to come down and fight but only one was stupid enough to come down.     A comical attempt at grabbing the goblin ended up with a badger and player lieing in the mud with the goblin escaping.  Getting bored the party carried on.  One the outskirts of [[Amme]] the badgers refused to go any further stating that it smelt of Humans and goblins.

The badgers agreed to stay for two days waiting for the party to return in return of a badger helmet.

Once inside the town the party was welcomed by [[Tiz]] the Mayor of [[Amme]].   He stated that he was worried about the goblins as it had halted trade and the caravan the party was the first in many a week.

The party snitched on the dodgy merchant stating he had a hidden dagger.    [[Tiz]] ordered his guards to collect the dagger, on examination he stated it was a dwarfed dagger. Examining the arrow head he stated it looked fine metal and old but his blacksmiths would be able to provide more info.

The party headed for a blacksmith and he examined the arrow head stating it was old Dwarven metal from a time 300 years ago when Dwarfs lived in [[Vellenoweth]].   It was very rare and unusual.   The party then did some shopping the helm was made into a badger shaped helm and a "+5" rapier was bought.

A brief stop in a tavern ended up with a fight with 3 commoners ended up with one dead one unconcuis and one fled.

Returning to [[Tiz]] with the information on the arrow head he refereed them to the towns scholar [[Kim]] who stated that 300 years dwarfs were expelled from [[Vellenoweth]]  They then abounded the town on the lost wet road and he believed there was a hidden town on the peninsular of [[Gorran]].  He recommended the party find the dwarfs as they could provide more information.

The party agreed and left the town, returning to the badgers and fitting one with a helm.  The badgers refused to go with the party to the town on the lost road instead returning to nature.

Heading down the wet road the party came across the town with large walls and a locked gate.    The wall ended by the river/sea so one party decided to swim around.   Unfortunately two hungry reef sharks attacked.  An unfortunate Nat 1 meant a long sword was dropped lost to the sea.   Retreating to the bank the party regrouped and plotted another way into the city.
