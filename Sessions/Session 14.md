With the party separated the new prison warden reduced his own ransom to 1,000,000GP and moved their bodies to a more secure cell.

At the gate the goblins came back to work saying it was worth the danger to free their kind from oppression.

The auditor attempted to bluff their way into the armoury to get their weapons back but the clerk goblins refused entry so an angry cat was trust in to ones face.   A short fight with a war hammer and a halibut ended with one dead and one unconscious goblin.   The Halibut wielding goblin did a surprising amount of damage before being not unconscious.

The weapons were then smuggled out in a box of wet fish.

Back inside [[Vellenoweth]] The party declared the flagship fixed and set off for a test sail.   it headed off in the wrong direction so the anchor was dropped in an attempt to stop.   The sails were then set fire too and a cannon was fired which had the unfortunate effect of starting the invasion.  The flag ship was sunk with half the crew lost.

Two managed to escape and went to the mages tower to get a weather forecast, there one was promoted to Admiral.  

Back in the prison the ransom notes were sent to the usual place.  The party also found out that the brain swap machine would be fixed in 2 days.

A lost party member was painted yellow so the rest could keep track of him.  This lead to red, yellow blue and green leader of which only two survived.  Using mage hand the party manged to blow up a further 4 ships.

Back at the key gate unfortunately the party supplied the worker goblins with potions of speed and the gate opened a bit.  The wizards guards started to get a bit suspicious and were killed by the party.
