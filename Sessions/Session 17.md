Approaching the cave the party noticed a yellow stain in the water, this turned out to be Chicken Brain!  Hauling Chicken Brain aboard the party got side tracked by a haunting song,   3 of the party were mesmerised with chicken brain having to save the day by firing the cannon at the Siren killing it with one shot.

inside the cave the party found an abandoned dock with 3 warehouses.  Investigating, they found a rust monster eating a stair case in one and a feckless grey ooze in another.     The grey ooze just oozed as the party walked past it.

The rust monster was a bit more tricky but soon turned  into a pile of rust with lots of firebolts.

In the warehouse a potion of swimming was found along with more amulates and some stone tablets engraved with "3 is not 1".

At the other end of the dock was a ramp descending into the water, off this ramp were 3 tunnels.  One above the water, one just in the water and one mostly full of water.  Chicken Brain went for a swim in the full one and was thrown back out by a wall of water.

The party then investigated the middle passage,  just inside were four grates in the walls tentacles came out and tried to grab the party but failed.  The party bravely retreated.

The only remaining passage was dry with a rotten door, an attempt to push the door open ended badly as tentacles and teeth erupted from the door trapping the leading party member.
Again fire bolts came to the rescue and surprisingly no party members were singed in the defeat of the mimic.

passing though the door a chamber was found with 3 passage ways.  of course the party decided to split up.  One went up and found the top of the island which looked like abandoned industrial land with a magic wall hiding it from the sea.

Another group seems to have wandered into a maze.   The remaining party members went down and found a huge chamber with lots of industrial building inside.
