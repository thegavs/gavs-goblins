Clever use of Mage hand rescued the dropped long sword, a rope was attached to the top of the wall and the party climbed up and entered the deserted city.

Unfortunately the city was not quiet as deserted as 6 skeletons came out of the watch towers.   Standing above the skeletons heavy rocks were dropped, unfortunately onto a characters foot!  trapped on the roof some characters decided to take a nap whilst others did the fighting. Some risky climbing later lead to even riskier falling and a character on death saves.

After the remaining skeletons were dispatched the party took a long rest in a locked watch tower.   When the skeletons started to reassemble  an attempt was made to throw skulls out of windows.  As the skulls were larger than the windows this went badly and accelerated the rebuilding so the party fled.

The whole town was ruined having been abandoned 300 years before but a new rowing boat was spotted so the party went to investigate.  5 dead goblins were around the boat looking like they had been killed by claws and bites rather than blades and arrows.

Investigating the body's found a map and 3 potions.   2 healing and one of speed.  with nothing else to loot the goblins were thrown to the sharks.

4 sahuagins then emerged from the water and attacked the party.  Even with the sahuagins hitting each other the party were soon in trouble until the speed potion was taken.  The remaining sahuagin slid back into the water, wounded the party were still alive.
