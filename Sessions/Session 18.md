The party continued to explore the isle of [[Gorran]]. Using a trampoline a party member manged to bounce his way upto the surface where he joined in picking up shinny rocks.

In the maze the party became aware that they were not alone with a depressed Minator stalking them.   Back on the boat a siren song charmed one player with the other having to use sleep to stop them walking into the water.

Back in the maze a chase ensured that ended up in a passage with a hole that lead to the dock so there were now 2 fights on the dock.

Up above the party fell down a hole and ended up back at the docks in the middle of the fight.   The siren attempted to charm the rest of the party but fortunately for the party only managed to charm the Minator.   The wounded party withdrew and let the monsters fight.  Once only the siren was left the party finished it off.

Each character has 4476XP and is level 4 still.

Am planning to end the campaign at the end of august start of September.
