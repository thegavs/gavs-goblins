The party having acquired battery's headed back to the room where their bodies still laid alive but dormant.  An animated discussion was heard in the room, it appeared another attempt at body swapping had been done with debatable results.  In one room zombie like brainless goblins walking into walls.  In the other room the original bodies were able to sit up and answer questions.

The wizard and goblin technicians seem to be confused as it appears the mind transfer had either failed or the party was made up of imbeciles as the old bodies appeared barely intelligent.  The party in the bodies of goblins bluffed their way into the room, finding out that the brainless goblins were to be eaten the party suggested killing and eating them now.

The rest of the goblins were shocked at the suggestion of raw food and told the party to take the zombie goblins to the kitchen.   An attempt at creating a distraction with minor illusion and the unexpected affect of bring the cat Grebo out of hiding, with talk with animals it trusted the party in their new guise. The goblins were delivered to the kitchen and as a reward they party got to take some snake eggs as a reward.

Back in the body swap rooms the Wizard was summoned away by a messenger goblin.  The party took the opportunity to try to swap back into one of their bodies.  This failed as magic smoke was released.

The party were then asked to take their old bodies to the prison a few levels up/down.  In the prison the party found some merchants and town guards with ransoms written on the doors.  The party locked the old bodies into cells and wrote the ransom on the doors.   One is due to be ransomed for 6,700,000GP and could be there a while.

Wandering into a break room the party used the auditor trick to find out that Jeff had been adding a 0 to some ransoms and taking the difference.   Using this information and a fog distraction the party manged to free some dwarfs and steal pages from a ledger outlining who had been body swapped.

The party they went to the wizards room as auditors and took charge of the prison, storerooms and stuck gate.

Investigating the stuck gate the party realised it was a water gate that was the only thing stopping warships existing the tunnel to [[Vellenoweth]] they convinced the goblins working on it that was dangerous magic and they should flee.  Investigating the gate they found it was locked by magic.  Tied up were barges powered by magic.  Some of the party took one of these barges along the underground river.

Half a day later they emerged into a lake surrounded by a bustling city.   Sitting at anchor were 56 warships ready to set sail.   Still bluffing the party demanded to investigate the flag ship  seeing it was powered by the magic pedestal combination the party rewired it to operate backwards and at full speed.
