Having defeated the animated armour the party took a gauntlet as proof they were there.   As there were two staircases heading up out of this room the party split up.   Hearing noises from the next floor "protect from good and evil" was cast.     Luckily the two parties realised the noise was the other party before a fight occurred.  In the centre of the room was a pedestal covered with dwarfen writing and two fist shaped holes in.

Unable to read the carvings the party took rubbings of them for [[Kim]] the scholar to look at later.  Attempts were made to active the pedestal by forcing the captured Saughin to put its hands in the slots.  Nothing happened.

Eventually the amulate found in the lower room was placed in the slot which made brass tubes lower from the ceiling.   Saughin blood was placed in the tubes only to have it returned, then a goblin ear had the same effect.   The Drwafen gauntlet had the same effect.    An attempt to decapitate the Saughin lead to the rope tying them to be cut and fishman escaping.

The party went to the roof and  found that one of the brass tubes were pointing at the Sentinel.

Unable to discover the reason behind the tubes the party decided to investigate the light house.     unable to get their on foot the party commandeered the row boat and lost all but one oars getting to the light house.   Inside the lighthouse some suspicious looking barrels blinked at the party then attacked as the party had stumbled into a next of giant centipedes.

These were soon dispatched and the exoskeleton cut up to use as badger amour the party investigated one of the room seeing a chest resting on rotten wooden floor.    A rope was attached to one member, unfortunately the floor gave way and the chest fell into the water below.

A tug of war on the chest between the party and a giant crab dragged the crab into the room with the players.    Luckily it got stuck in the door and soon the party feasted on crab claw when long resting.  Unfortunately the "+5" rapier turned out to be a dud and snapped in half during the fight.

The rescued chest was unfortunately trapped and contained nothing of interest.

The next morning the party headed upwards finding a room with a map possibly of trade routes.   The party drew it then headed to the light at the top and lite it using oil found in the light house. As it was a bright sunny day this had little effect.

The party returned to [[Amme]] and consulted [[Kim]] who using the maps identified an island off the coast as a possible location of [[Gorran]].   Unfortunately [[amme]] has no boats and due to Pirates the party decided to head to [[Morkam]] to find a ship.
