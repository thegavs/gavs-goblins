Session 9 started with a nap and the theme continued with lots of sleeping during fights!

The party continued towards [[Nivag]] but heard a party of goblins coming so rushed to attack.  The goblins had captured a gnome and the party rushed to rescue him, unfortunately a few nat 1s meant the party needed to be rescued by the plucky gnome!

The celebrations of defeating the 5 goblins were curtailed as another 5 goblins appeared by [[Kim]] and the Captain of the guard.     Both were of no use in the fight as the captain was traumatised and [[Kim]] only interested in recording the battle.  Some of the party rushed to the new battle as other goblins appeared behind the party.

Isolated one of the party members was knocked unconscious and the goblins started to drag them off.    Unfortunately the road surface proved tricky for the party with many falling prone.  Luckily the newly acquired cat disliked goblins and managed to dispatch a few goblins.   Just as it looked like a TPK the badgers rushed in and saved the party.

Making it to [[Nivag]] the badgers again slipped back into the Forrest with the party having a long rest in an inn paid for by the Captain of the guard.

The next day after shop successful shopping the party met the mayor in the town hall.  He thanked them for what they have done and rewarded them with 20GP each.  The goblin detecting rapiers glowed dimly when close to the mayor,  the party split up to distract the mayor and when alone in his office they looked for secret panels in his office.   The party commanded the goblin hating cat to investigate and it was very interesting in a panel in a wall.  Having failed to find a secret lever in the bookshelf they broke the panel down.  The Cat rushed in to a tiny tunnel behind the panel.   Wild shaping the druid also changed into a cat and followed.

After a short pause both cats came out with mouth fulls of rats.
