The party decided to split up as surely it would not end badly this time!   Half the party stayed with the "rescued" Mayor [[Doniert Craddick]], the other half went to scout  out the western end of the lost wet road.

Finding a long bridge the party started to cross it when croaking sounds were heard all around,  they correctly identified an impending ambush.     Two Bullywugs riding giant Leeches attached from the river, one was swiftly killed before it got to the bridge.

More Bullywugs leapt onto the bridge and a battle on two fronts was almost won successfully,   that was until the giant blood sucking Leeches got involved!  It turns out that using Thunderwave when a Giant Leech is attached to the spell caster ends badly!

With the attack over a lot of healing was needed, this was a theme for the rest of the session.  An amulet similar to the one find at the other end of the lost road was found on a body

At the end of the bridge was a keep with a rotten wooden drawbridge, the 15 foot gap was jumped by two of the party (with the assistance of a grasshopper).  The remaining member decided to tie a rope to get across, unfortunately this ended up badly with the character both getting wet and attacked by a giant leech.

Once inside the keep the party decided to find a place to long rest and heel,  a nest of constrictor snakes seemed the logical place to rest.   An attempt to persuade the snakes that the party were not attempting to steal the snakes baby's ended with a battle and the party stealing the snakes baby's.

Investigating a tower the party found and activated another pedestal, this had viewing tubes pointed at the Sentinel, along with some sail like contraptions.   Attempts to understand the levers and sails ended badly with snapping sounds.

Investigating further the party found a great hall with suits of armour.  One of these turned out to be animated and attacked the party.   With an unusual show of competence the party soon defeated it and found a +1 great axe along with a potion of speed and healing potion.
