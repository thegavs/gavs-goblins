The party regrouped on the dock and decided as the tide had dropped to explore the other two passages from the dock.

Half went into the one with the grates and tentacles.   As the water level had dropped the tentacles did not appear.  Past the tentacles there were stairs leading down,  at the bottom was a 40' passage with grates in the floor.  beneath the grate the party heard machinery pumping the water out.  Lifting the grate the party fire bolted the machinery.   This caused the machinery to stop flooding the passage, fleeing to the other end of the passage way finding stairs leading to a control room.

The other half of the party went into the lower passage way which still had a foot of water in.   Along the passage the water rose up and an invisible creature within attacked the party.  A great axe was lost in the battle but the creature either was killed or snuck off.

Carrying along the passage the passage rose above the water then dropped to a cavern.   In the control room fired fire bolts into the furnaces and then pulled random levers and started to feed the furnaces.    In the cavern under the furnaces the party watched mine carts roll into the furnaces.

Meeting up in another cavern the party heard a dragon approaching in a tunnel and set out to fight it.    However the dragon was just molten metal from the furnace.

Each player has 4651 XP and is still level 4.
