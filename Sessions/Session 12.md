Half of the party decided to abandon the Mayor in the woods and rejoin the rest of the party along the rest road.  Having tracked down the larger part of the party by following the behead corpses along the road.

Once inside the Keep they soon found the party by the crashing and shouts of "oh fuck".   A trapped door was barged open but luckily the poisoned dart missed the barger.  A undisturbed barracks room was found with beds still occupied.   Amusing the occupants of the beds were long dead the party started to loot,   the long dead zombies reacted to having their bodies being robbed and a fight ensured.

The two players in the room initially took a lot of hits before deciding to burn the zombies with cone of fire.   The random elemental orb was throw into the mix which turned into a Magma Mepfit which once ordered to smoked the remaining zombies,  5 gold rings worth 5GP were found on the smouldering corpses.

An attempt to show a paper map to a creature of fire ended up with a confused creature and no map!

The party decided to head for the looming Sentinel that seemed to be the centre of goblin activitiy.   Heading up river by boat the party found the river came out of a cave mouth in the middle of the looming Sentinel.   Sending the Magma Mephfit in as a scout went well once the party asked the right questions.   Initially it reported that there were fish in the cave, when asked about the number of fish  the Mephfit replied 7452 small fishes and two giant leeches lurked under the water.

Having ascertained that there were no goblin or men inside the cave only women the party entered only to be trapped by a falling portcullis.   A chilling voice boomed out "we have been expecting you!"  Then it all  went dark.

Waking up in a dark room some of the party quickly discovered that they could not only see in the dark and understood goblin but were in fact goblins.   The slightly slower members of the party legged it out of the room into the next room were some humans and goblins were arguing about magic battery's being needed to complete the transfer.  On slabs were the original bodies of the party.  The party now goblins were ordered to take their original weapons to the armoury they report to their barracks. 

The party bluffed their way into the armoury as auditors the party intimated the goblins and found a discrepancy in the number of arrow heads.   Having found that the battery's were kept in another store room the party checked in their superior weapons and left with random goblin weapons.

Going to the other store room the party again used the auditor bluff to gain access with some lighting based distraction stole 4 batterys to be used in an attempt to gain their bodies back.
