Session 3 started with most of the party running bravely away from a goblin behind a door.   The remaining 3 characters set a trap for the goblins.   Unfortunately only one goblin appeared and  did not trigger the trap so a short but ineffective battle with arrows ended up with goblin and party running away!

The party noticed a splash in the river far below and a different goblin running away.  Climbing back to the road the party continued towards [[Amme]].  As night drew in they camped in a clearing, as a trophy a goblin head was placed on a spike as a warning to other goblins and possibly [[Sizzle]].  Towards the end of the evening the sentry noticed some movement so alerted the party.   Two sneaked towards the movement and found a giant badger and used "talks with animals" to engage it.  Unfortunately they did not notice the other two giant badgers that came into the campsite, one going for the goblin head on the stick the other attacking the remaining party member.

Now it turns out that Giant badgers are a bit evil so chased the party member up a tree.  A truce was negotiated with the badgers with the help of Honey and the promise of amour.

The party then returned to the bridge and investigated the other cave.  This lead back to the door the goblins were hiding in.   once the door was broken down two goblins were soon slain.     Investigating the room they found two healing potions and a potion of speed along with labels in a language they did not understand.

Hidden under a rug was a trap door, leading to a dark tunnel.    Two party members along with badgers managed to "investigate" it, or just plain fell down it!

This tunnel was like a water slide leading into the river 200ft below.   Leading to two wet and angry badgers.

One of the party somehow manged to climb back up the tunnel leaving its badger with the smarter party member who decided to walk the long way back to the road.

Once back on the road they met up with the merchants and [[Sizzle]]  camping again for the night the party investigated the cart of a merchant they had not seen before.  Finding a chest they found a fine dagger hidden,  not trusting the new merchant who stated he was the first to be attacked by the goblins they intimidated him.

The next morning the party set off again stopping by another bridge as the badgers started to get anxious.
