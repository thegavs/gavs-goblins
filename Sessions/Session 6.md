The session started by the party taking a nap to long rest.   Their slumber was interrupted by a commotion on the street outside,  3 sahuagins had captured a goblin and had it tied up and poking it with spears.

The party tried to talk to the captors but the small issue of not sharing a common language lead to a big problem of a fight.  The goblin was rescued and frisked but nothing was found.  The bodies of the vanquished sahuagins were looted but only crab claws in varying degrees of decomposition were found.  Heads were chopped off to impress [[Sizzle]] and the corpses fed to the fishes.

The goblin was interrogated and sated was sent to investigate the tower and find the pedestal, all this friends had been killed by the sahuagins.  He was sent by a large hobgoblin but had no other information.

The goblin lead the party to the tower on the bridge,  inside the main hall was a pile of junk pilled up in the middle of the room.  In an attempt to gain more information from the goblin its arse was kicked, unfortunately this ended badly with the goblin kicking arse and escaping.

The Goblin was entangled at the end of the hall but transformed into  a SeaHag, given the threat and distance a potion of speed was used to close the gap.  The Hag's death glare made two characters frightened with the remaining passing the saving throws.  Bless was cast on characters to help.   Entangle is a double edged spell with both characters and the Seahag falling over!   A final death glare put one character on death saves before the hag was dispatched and decapitated, the the corpse fed to the fishes.  The party investigated half of the junk pile finding nothing of interest,  the looting was interrupted by 4 sahuagins piling in.  Seeing the head of the Seahag their boss they fled, well 3 did one fell over and was captured.

The rest of the room was looted and a bag of holding and an Element Gem was found.

The party headed up higher in the tower dragging the captured sahuagin up.  A dusty room was found with 4 suits of drawfen armour was found, unfortunately  one was animated and attacked the party.  The player holding the rope to the sahuagin fell over this lead to the sahuagin attempting to escape and tangle up the party, luckily they fell over and the party dispatched the amour.

Hidden behind the amour was a +1 great axe, a potion of healing and a golden amulet.   The other suits of Amour were looted to varying degrees of success, one play found a staff of Adornment, the other player found out that suits of amour hurt when they fall on them.
