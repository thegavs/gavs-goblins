Before heading back to [[Morkam]] the party went shopping, unfortuantly not many had gold to spare so had to take a loan of 25GP from [[Kim]] to be able to replace broken weapons.    The dwarfen gauntlet was found to be near worthless.

The party managed to sell some weapons for 90GP including a goblin scimitar for 30GP.  Flush with cash the party looked for new weapons and almost bought a goblin scimitar that had just come into the shop for 35GP.  A pair of fine rapiers were bought that alledgerly glowed in the preasance of goblins.

Moving onto a different shop run by an elf the party attempted to barter/intimidate the shop keeper to buy a particularly large bow.    Attempts to barter with hag heads and centipede shell fell on deaf ears as the elf was a Vegan.

In order to afford the giant bow the party had to take some money from the ransom they had got to pay for the release of the captain of the guard.    The Giant bow has a range of 100/300 and deals 1D10 damage.

Going into a pet shop to buy a sabre tooth tiger the party realised that maybe a scimitar toothed cat might be more in their price range.   Using speak with animals the party found out that the Scimitar toothed cats were in fact normal cats with goblin teeth glued into their mouths.  Further investigation found out that [[Sizzle]] was providing the goblin teeth.   Asking about other interesting animals the party found some swamp dragons, which looked interesting but upon hearing that they had a habit of exploding when excited they soon passed.

Feeling they should buy something the party left with a particularly ugly and large cat called Grebo.

Finding a back street armourer the party got excited that they could afford chain mail.  Unfortunately the length of chain they could afford was quite short and would end up looking like a armoured bikini with gold tassels.

Giving up the party had a long rest and headed out on the low road to pay the ransom.   The exchange went well and the rapiers did indeed glow near the goblins.  The Captain of the Guard was happy  to be  rescued.  The party attempted to gain information from the captain, he revealed that he was taken to a lair between the two bridges and a large hobgoblin was in charge.  Captain [[Blejan]] held [[Sizzle]] in high regard as he was good at killing goblins.

The party were suspicious of both [[Blejan]] and other key people in [[Nivag]] had been charmed but had no way of proving it.

The party made camp and had an uneventful long rest.
