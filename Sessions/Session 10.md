We join the party again as they break down a wall inside the mayors office to find a rats nest not goblins.  The Mayor returns and is happy with the rat catchers and invites them to dinner at his new mansion.     Our shape shifting druid disguised as a cat decides to follow [[Brek]] he was followed to a cobblers before the wild shape wore off.  Unfortunately  the change from a cat was witnessed by small children who ran off screaming about witches.

The party joined the mayor for a fine dinner served by a maid who kept telling everyone to eat more plants.   An attempt to find out what she was on about ended up with threats of HR being called.   A second attempt ended with the maid changing demeaner and holding a knife to the charactors throat, the maid was in fact [[Mellyn]] the spy master and the party had forgotten that plant was the code word.   [[Mellyn]] wanted an update to the parties mission. 

The new rouge took the opertunity to break into the town hall where he found [[Brek]] rooting around in the mayors office.    [[Brek]] was uncomplaining about the mayor had all the money and none for hard working [[Brek]].  After [[Brek]] left the rouge round invoices for the [[Doniert Craddick]] house at 1500Gp and that the tax income from the town was 700GP a month.  Breaking into the cobblers the rouge found red leather and golden thread.  Going upstairs the gnome cobbler was found making some huge red kinky boots for [[Brek]]s wife.

Back in the mayors house a distraction by fainting allowed the party to explore without the mayor.   Hidden in the attic was a telescope and communication devices aimed at a hidden cave.   in the cellar nothing was found but the party decided to say goblins in the cellar and they would "rescue" the mayor.

The party had to knock out two guards to get the mayor to the woods where after interrogation the mayor [[Doniert Craddick]] admitted fiddling taxes and he was captured and released by the goblins.
